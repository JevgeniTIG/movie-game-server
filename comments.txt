Endpoints:

1) /movie-game/two-movies-for-comparison
This is to get two movies for their comparison. Required values are sent as request params.
My goal was not to expose possibly sensitive data as popularity, run time, revenue and vote average.
These four categories are evaluated by game player and I did not want to show the player such data. So a player cannot
cheat, using a browser inspect panel.

2) /movie-game/guess
This is meant to evaluate player's guess. Required values are sent as request params.

3) /movie-game/movie/get/{id}
This is created so a user can check if vote count logic works correctly.
Required value for event id is sent as a path variable.
